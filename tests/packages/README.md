The test naming in this folder is a folllows:
- `stt`: static targert
- `sht`: shared target
- `stf`: static foo (package name)
- `shf`: shared foo (package name)
- `stb`: static bar
- `shb`: shared bar

So a test name like: `stt-shf-stb`, test in the following configuration: static target, shared foo, static bar
